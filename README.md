## About

Of Longing and Fear is a browser based video and sound installation, developed as the result of the workshop Javascript for Sound Artist of the Browser Sound Festival 2023 (Stuttgart and online, 21-22 July 2023). The piece is based on my artistic research project in 2021, [T_AKUT](https://sastraswara.site/works/takut.html), funded by the Musikfonds. In this proof-of-concept work, a collection of permutated location, dates, and text are presented to the visitor, along with a collage of video and sound.

The work follows "diaries" of historical witness living during the time of Japanese occupation in Indonesia between 1942-1945. Through permutations, historical facts, geospatical locations, and figures becomes blurry: the historical witness becomes an anonymous figure, and the stories are unified only by the figures' expression of longing and fear during that period. One can only guess, whether the "diary entry" belongs to an Indonesian modernist or a Japanese pilot.

Through this work, I would like to explore and imagine a humane shared experience by the people under the three different forces colliding at that period: the Netherland Indies, the Imperial Japan, and the emerging Indonesia as a nation. I find there an ironic meaning-play with the festival's theme Location Sharing. In the midst of a period full of social and political turmoil, life still needs to be lived. An internet browser takes a function of a memorial shrine, where one may stay and reflect.

## Direction and Implementation

It is recommended to use a laptop or PC to explore the work with a pair of good speaker or headphone. Although my preference is to enjoy this in solitary, it is always a grateful ocassion to experience it in the good company of other. 

The multimedia presentation is made with p5.js., while the processing of recorded sounds, creation of collages, and sound composition are realized in Supercollider. It is tested and works on Firefox, but it seems to fail in Chrome. The experience in a smartphone might not be optimum yet. I plan to improve and address these issues in due time.
